## Non Functional Requirements

### Performance and Scalability

**Performance** deals with the measure of the system's response time under different load conditions.

**Scalability** Assesses the highest workloads under which the system will still meet the performance requirements.

### Reliability, Maintainability and Availability

**Reliability** Specifies the probability of the software performing without failure for a specific number of uses or amount of time.

**Maintainability** Indicates the average time, ease and rapidity with which a system can be restored after a failure.

**Availability** describes how likely the system is accessible for a user at a given point in time.

### Security

**Security** assesses if all data inside the system or it's part will be protected against threat vectors or unauthorized access.

### Portability and Compatibility

**Portability** determines how a system or its element can be launched within one environment or the other.

**Compatibility** defines how a system can co-exist with another system in the same environment.
