# Data Flow Diagrams

In system development life cycle, a system model can be developed using Data Flow Diagram. DFD is used in defining the requirements in a graphical view. 

A Data Flow Diagram consists of:

- Processes: an activity or a function that is performed for some specific business reason;
- Data Flows: a single piece of data or a logical collection of several pieces of
information;
- Data Stores: a collection of data that is stored in some way;
- External Entites: a person, organization, or system that is external to the system but
interact with it. 

Rules of data flow diagrams:

- At least one input or output data flow for external entity
- At least one input data flow and/or at least one output data flow for a process
- Output data flows usually have different names than input data flows for a process
- Data flows only in one direction
- Every data flow connects to at least one process 

In a DFD, names needs to be unique, to properly be identified. 

There are 2 levels for DFDs, to provide context or details: level-0 and level-1.

Exercise: ordering and delivering goods.
